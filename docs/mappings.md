## Mappings

Label to ontology mappings of different nature:
  - `pValueText.tsv`: resolving p-value annotation in GWAS Catalog association table using their [abbreviation list](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/abbreviations)
  - [biosystem](../mappings/biosystem).
    - Labels of anatomical structures such as tissues, organs or systems are mapped to the [UBERON ontology](https://uberon.github.io).
    - Labels of cell lines are mapped to the [Cell Line Ontology](http://www.clo-ontology.org).
  - [disease](../mappings/disease). Labels of diseases mapped to the [EFO ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/). This directory is pending to be harmonised under a common file (see [#1400](https://github.com/opentargets/platform/issues/1400) for context).
