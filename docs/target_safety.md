## Target Safety annotation 

Manual curation of experimental data and insights from publications and other well-known sources of target safety and toxicity data, including the Tox21 database.

The annotation related to `safety_risks.tsv` and `adverse_effects.tsv` is currently being fed to the Platform's pipelines, whereas `experimental_toxicity.tsv` has been discontinued in favour of a new pipeline that processes [ToxCast data files](https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/toxcast-data-accessing-toxcast-data-and-scenarios-exploring-data).
